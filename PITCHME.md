## A bit about me

- A newbie software engineer |
- Graduate Engineer in Boeing | 
- Software Engineer at Red Hat |
- Lead Org for NodeGirls Brisbane |

Note: 
up until my role in boeing, everyhting was a little different. in uni you are spoon fed quite a lot,
even though coming from high school it may not seem like it. Deadlines are still very clear, 
and there is a clearly defined timeline of when u should be doing what. I mean its upto you
to skip a lecture, but then you know u have to come back to it or learn that info at some point before 
the next tute or exam. 
But with both red hat and node girls, i was quite a lot more free in terms of time management.

# Procrastination

### The icecream-for-breakfast of my time management

Note:
There are many reasons why people procrastinate. 
I know one of the big reasons why i procrastinate is a fear of failure.
It can be a lack of motivation. 
but especially early on in my self managed learning environment when i was used to being supervised more
It felt like moving out of your parents house at a young age feels. like you suddenly realise that
you can eat icecream for breakfast. 
its something that you know you shouldn't be doing, but it feels good so you do it and then
you judge yourself. 
It hindered my productivity
and i've gotten a lot of advice in the months since that time that i've taken on.
And i'm here to share what i've tried, whats worked and what hasnt.

# Use Trello 

Good for
- To-do lists |
- Personal reminders |
- Delegation |

Note:
delegation is a lifesavers for NodeGirls boards,
we even used it for moving house
Prioritisation is a life saver for myself

## Make friends with your calendar app

- Do some planning prep before the week starts |
- Look at the plan for the day before you do anything else |

Note:
Now that you have the items in your todo list, we need to look at when you can and need to do them
get an overview of what you have going so you have a general idea of how to tackle the week.
If you look at emails before you look at your tasks, you get distracted
